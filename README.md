# BLOX City

This project is a complete and carefully reconstructed clone of Bloxcity.com as it existed in 2017, developed in 2024 with the goal of preserving one of the platform’s most memorable eras. Built with a strong emphasis on historical accuracy, this recreation mirrors the original website’s design, structure, and functionality as closely as possible, providing an authentic experience for those who remember the platform and an opportunity for new users to explore a piece of internet history.

Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is digital preservation. Many classic online platforms disappear over time, taking their unique design philosophies and community-driven features with them. This clone serves as both a tribute and a technical showcase, demonstrating how legacy web experiences can be faithfully rebuilt while maintaining modern reliability behind the scenes.

Features

- Fully recreated 2017 interface — Layouts, color palettes, typography, and navigation were rebuilt to match the original site.
- Classic pages restored — Includes the home page, user profiles, catalog, groups, forums, game listings, and more.
- Authentic user experience — Interactions and workflows were designed to behave similarly to the original platform.
- Avatar customization — Recreated systems allow users to personalize their appearance just like in the 2017 version.
- Community elements — Forums, groups, and social features reflect the collaborative spirit that defined Bloxcity.
- Legacy-inspired design — Button styles, icons, spacing, and other subtle details were carefully studied and reproduced.

Development Approach

Creating this clone required extensive research using archived materials such as screenshots, historical references, and available documentation. Every component was analyzed to ensure accuracy, from large structural elements down to small visual nuances.

While the front-end experience remains faithful to the original, the underlying architecture benefits from modern development practices to improve stability, maintainability, and performance. This balance allows the project to preserve the past without sacrificing present-day technical standards.

Purpose

This repository is intended for educational, archival, and demonstration purposes only. It highlights web reconstruction techniques, UI replication, and the challenges involved in recreating legacy platforms.
